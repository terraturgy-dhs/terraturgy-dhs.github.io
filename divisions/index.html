            <h1>DIVISIONS</h1>
            <p>Divisions work in a system that is unique currently no other faction.</p><p>As you're probably reading this while you're a trainee agent, you'll either be placed or be permitted to choose which division you go into. Once you're there, that is where you will operate.</p><p>There is technically no "main force" as all divisions fit that role, each with their own specializations and duties.</p><p>You can view information about each division in their respective spot on this page.</p>

            <h2>SWITCHING DIVISIONS</h2>
            <p>You'll have to follow your current divisions leaving proceedure, which can vary between each.<p></p>Leaving a division will result in you being placed back to special agent, in which you'll have to work your way up in a new division.<p></p>However, you may also submit a transfer request to the command of your current division and the one you're planning to join. If you are approved then you'll be placed into the new division with a rank similar to the one you held previously.</p>
